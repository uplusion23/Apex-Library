# Apex-Library
A lightweight, beautiful game library consolidator and launcher built on NodeJS and Node-Webkit. Supports common game libraries and custom games such as DRM Free (*pirated*) games.

### FAQ
1. **How do I add games that require Steam or UPlay?**
  - You can add a custom game under `Settings` -> `Add Custom Game`, and for the launch code, use the Steam or Uplay run URI.
    * **Example:** `steam://rungameid/{GAME ID}`
